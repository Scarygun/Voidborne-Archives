*"A Chronicle of Shadows, Exploits, and the Unseen War"*  

## 🎯 **Purpose of the Void**  
This repository is:  
- A **dark mirror** of my journey from fledgling sysadmin to red team sovereign.  
- A **sanctum** for code, configs, and exploits birthed in my homelab’s crucible.  
- A **warning** to complacent systems: *the void watches*.  

*"What you see here is not static. It evolves as I do. Each commit is a scar, each branch a battlefield."*
