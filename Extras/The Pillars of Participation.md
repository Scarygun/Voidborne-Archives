Greetings, noble seekers and digital scribes! As you prepare to inscribe your wisdom into our poetic, lore-driven roadmap, please embrace the following guiding tenets:

- **Honor the Lore:** Every contribution must weave seamlessly into our epic narrative. Use lyrical language and evocative metaphors to illuminate even the most technical insights.
    
- **Clarity Amidst Poetry:** While our words are meant to sing, they must also instruct. Ensure that each tip, rule, or insight is clear enough to guide a fellow traveler along this path.
    
- **Respect the Ancient Scrolls:** Our roadmap is a living testament to the legacy of cyber warriors. Preserve the spirit of collaboration, integrity, and respect in all your contributions.
    
- **Embody the Journey:** Share your expertise as if recounting a saga. Every command, concept, and piece of advice should reflect the passion of a lifelong quest for mastery.
    
- **Balance Art and Utility:** Let your words be both beautiful and useful. The magic lies in blending poetic expression with concrete, actionable steps.
    
- **Keep the Flame Alive:** As our community grows, let each contribution add to the mythos, fueling the inspiration of those who come after you.
    

May your contributions be as timeless as legends and as practical as the tools of a master artisan. Together, we forge a roadmap that not only guides, but inspires the next generation of cyber warriors.

Welcome to the journeyâ€”where every word matters and every contribution is a step towards greatness.
