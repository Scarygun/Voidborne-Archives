It all started with a game. Not just any game, but a cracked one. Back then, I didn’t care about cybersecurity—I just wanted to play. But as I stared at the modified files, something clicked. How did they crack it? What was happening under the hood? My curiosity ignited, and I needed answers.

The problem? I didn’t have a computer—only a mobile phone. But that didn’t stop me. I discovered Termux, installed every tool I could find, and dove headfirst into the world of hacking. My first real experiment? Phishing. I tricked a friend into opening a fake login page, gaining access to his camera. It was thrilling, but something felt off. Was this all hacking had to offer? It wasn’t enough. I wanted to understand more, to go beyond tricks and scripts. I wanted mastery.

Determined, I bought my first laptop. Kali Linux was my choice, the hacker’s OS. But when I booted it up, reality hit me—Kali wasn’t a magic button for hacking. It was complicated, overwhelming. Commands I barely understood, tools I couldn’t use properly. Doubt crept in. Maybe I wasn’t cut out for this.

For a while, my confidence wavered. But I didn’t quit. Slowly, I picked apart the basics, focusing on Linux itself instead of just hacking tools. Then, university came. The moment I stepped into my first tech class, everything changed. My classmates struggled with simple commands, but for me, they were second nature. The confidence I had lost came rushing back. I wasn’t just learning—I was ahead. 

Now, cybersecurity isn’t just a curiosity—it’s my path. Every challenge fuels me, every failure teaches me, and every system I secure reminds me why I started. From cracked games to a career in cybersecurity, my journey is just beginning.
