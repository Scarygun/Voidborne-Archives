# How to Evolve the Story?

1. After Major Milestones:

	- Add new Chapters with poetic titles (e.g., "The Day the Firewall Fell").
	- Update the Prophecy section to reflect progress.

2. For Tools/Exploits:

	- Write lore-driven documentation (e.g., "How to Summon a Reverse Shell").

3. For Failures:

	- Log them as "Echoes of the Abyss" with lessons learned.
