These VMs exist to be **attacked, exploited, DDoSed, and nuked**—all in the name of **offensive security**.

Some targets, like **DVWA**, must run inside **Docker containers**, meaning you can practice with just **Athena, Kali, or ParrotOS installed on bare metal**. But to **simulate real-world attack scenarios**, we deploy them on separate VMs.

For this task, **Fedora Server** is the best choice. 🛠️
